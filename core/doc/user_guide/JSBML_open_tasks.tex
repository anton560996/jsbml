The following is an incomplete list of tasks still remaining to be done to
complete JSBML.

\begin{itemize}

\item JSBML does not yet provide a stand-alone validator for SBML. It
  currently uses the online validator for SBML.

\item The support for SBML Level~3\index{SBML!Level~3} should be completed
  by implementing all extension packages.\index{SBML!extension packages}

\item The \codeSubindexed{{toSBML()}}{SBase}
  methods on \code{SBase} are missing.

\item Constructors and methods with namespaces are not yet provided.

\item The libSBML compatibility module\index{libSBML!compatibility module}
  needs to be fully implemented.

\item Also the \code{android} module is not ready yet.

\item A more general implementation for ontology access and manipulation in
  order to access other ontologies than just the SBO. See, for instance,
  the work of Courtot et al.~\cite{Courtot2011a} for details.\index{Ontology}

\end{itemize}
