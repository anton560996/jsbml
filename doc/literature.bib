	SBML is oriented towards describing biological processes of the sort
	common in research on a number of topics, including metabolic pathways,
	cell signaling pathways, and many others. SBML is defined neutrally
	with respect to programming languages and software encoding; however,
	it is oriented primarily towards allowing models to be encoded using
	XML. This document contains many examples of SBML models written
	in XML.

	at http://sbml.org/Documents/Specifications/.},

  month = {December},
  abstract = {With the rise of Systems Biology as a new paradigm for understanding
	biological processes, the development of quantitative models is no
	longer restricted to a small circle of theoreticians. The dramatic
	increase in the number of these models precipitates the need to exchange
	and reuse both existing and newly created models. The Systems Biology
	Markup Language (SBML) is a free, open, XML-based format for representing
	quantitative models of biological interest that advocates the consistent
	specification of such models and thus facilitates both software development
	and model exchange.
	
	Principally oriented towards describing systems of biochemical reactions,
	such as cell signalling pathways, metabolic networks and gene regulation
	etc., SBML can also be used to encode any kinetic model. SBML offers
	mechanisms to describe biological components by means of compartments
	and reacting species, as well as their dynamic behaviour, using reactions,
	events and arbitrary mathematical rules. SBML also offers all the
	housekeeping structures needed to ensure an unambiguous understanding
	of quantitative descriptions.
	
	This is Release 1 of the specification for SBML Level 2 Version 4,
	describing the structures of the language and the rules used to build
	a valid model. SBML XML Schema and other related documents and software
	are also available from the SBML project web site, http://sbml.org/.},

  abstract = {We present the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) Level 1, Version
	2, a description language for simulations in systems biology. SBML
	is oriented towards representing biochemical networks common in research
	on a number of topics, including cell signaling pathways, metabolic
	pathways, biochemical reactions, gene regulation, and many others.
	A recent conference (Kitano, 2001) highlights the range of topics
	that fall under the umbrella of systems biology and are in the domain
	of the description language defined here. Many contemporary research
	initiatives demonstrate the growing popularity of this kind of multidisciplinary
	work (e.g., Abbott, 1999; Gilman, 2000; Popel and Winslow, 1998;
	Smaglik, 2000a,b). SBML Level 1 is the result of merging modeling-language
	features from the following simulation systems: BioSpice (Arkin,
	2001), DBSolve (Goryanin, 2001; Goryanin et al., 1999), E-Cell (Tomita
	et al., 1999, 2001), Gepasi (Mendes, 1997, 2001), Jarnac (Sauro,
	2000; Sauro and Fell, 1991), StochSim (Bray et al., 2001; Morton-Firth
	and Bray, 1998), and Virtual Cell (Schaff et al., 2000, 2001). SBML
	was developed with the help of the authors of these packages. As
	a result of being based on actual working simulation software, it
	is a practical and functional description language. Our goal in creating
	it has been to provide an open standard that will enable simulation
	software to exchange models, something that is currently impossible
	because there is no standard model exchange language. We expect SBML
	models to be encoded using XML, the eXtensible Markup Language (Bosak
	and Bray, 1999; Bray et al., 1998), and we include here an XML Schema
	that defines SBML Level 1.},
