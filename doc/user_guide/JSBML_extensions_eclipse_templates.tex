\section{Eclipse code templates}

We created a set of Eclipse templates that would ease a lot the creation of all 
the methods described in the previous section of this chapter. These templates
can be downloaded from the JSBML sources repository at 
\url{https://jsbml.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jsbml/trunk/dev/eclipse/}.

The file \texttt{JSBML\_templates.xml} defines some code templates to autogenerate some code, following the
checklist defined in the previous section.
It can be included in \texttt{Java}~$\rhd$~\texttt{Editor}~$\rhd$ ~\texttt{Templates}.

To use these templates while programming write "JSBML" and press the \emph{control-tab} key. Then all 
available JSBML code templates are listed. Then select the desired template by pressing 
the \emph{enter} key. If you have several fields to rename, press the \emph{tab} key to rename them all in one go.
