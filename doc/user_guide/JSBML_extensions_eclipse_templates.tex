\section{Eclipse code templates}

We created a set of Eclipse templates that would ease a lot the creation of all 
the methods described in the previous section of this chapter. These templates
can be downloaded from the JSBML sources repository at 
\url{https://jsbml.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/jsbml/trunk/dev/eclipse/}.

The file JSBML\_templates.xml define some code templates to autogenerate some code, following the
checklist define in the previous section.
It can be included in "Java" -> "Editor" -> "Templates".

To use these templates while programming write "JSBML" and press "CTR + tab". Then all 
available JSBML code templates are listed. Then select the desired template by pressing 
"enter". If you have several fields to rename use "tab" to rename them all in one go.
