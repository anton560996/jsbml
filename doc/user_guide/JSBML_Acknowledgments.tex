The authors especiallythank the following individuals for their many contributions to JSBML (inalphabetical order):\begin{itemize}  \item Students from the Leibniz Institute of Plant Genetics and Crop Plant  Research (IKP), Gatersleben, Germany: Sebastian Fr\"ohlich.  \item Students from the Center for Bioinformatics Tuebingen (ZBIT), University  of Tuebingen, T\"ubingen, Germany:  Meike Aichele, Alexander Diamantikos, Jakob Matthes, Sarah Rachel M\"uller  vom Hagen, Sebastian Nagel, Eugen Netz, Jan Rudolph, Alexander Peltzer, and  Simon Sch\"afer  \item PhD students at the Center for Bioinformatics Tuebingen (ZBIT), University  of Tuebingen, T\"ubingen, Germany: Roland Keller and Johannes  Eichner.\end{itemize}In addition, JSBML has been fortunate to participate in the Google Summer of Code. Here are various information for these projects.\begin{itemize}\item Arrays package development, Leandro Watanabe: \url{http://lhwatanabe.blogspot.com/}\item CellDesigner Layout interface, Ibrahim Vazirabad: \url{http://jsbmlcelldesigner2014.blogspot.com/}\item ASTNode interface revamp, Victor Kofia: \url{http://kofiav.github.io/2015/08/03/astnode-vs-astnode2/}\end{itemize}The development of JSBML is currently funded by the following organizations:\begin{itemize}  \item The National Institute of General Medical Sciences (USA) via grant  number R01~GM070923,   \item The EMBL European Bioinformatics Institute (Germany and UK), and  \item The Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF, Germany) via  grant numbers 0315756 and 0315384C for the \emph{Virtual Liver Network}  and the MedSys (Medical Systems Biology) project \emph{Spher4Sys}.\end{itemize}Last but not least, JSBML is an open-source project, and we thank otherswho have helped in its progress, in the form of comments, bug reports, bugfixes, and other contributions.Other interested people are welcome to join the team and to contribute tothe project.  The JSBML Team also explicitely encourages students who wouldlike to participate in a large software project, to ask for currentJSBML subprojects that are in need of doing.
