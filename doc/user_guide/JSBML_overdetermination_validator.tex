\section{Determination of the variable in \codeNC{AlgebraicRule}s}

JSBML's \OverdeterminationValidator provides methods to determine if a given
model\index{model!over determination} is overdetermined; it uses the
algorithm of Hopcroft and Karp~\cite{Hopcroft1973}.

\OverdeterminationValidator simultaneously determines the free variable of
each \AlgebraicRule if possible. The class \AlgebraicRule also provides a
convenience method, \code{getDerivedVariable()}, to compute and return this
free variable.  However, we do not recommend calling this method except in
limited circumstances, because each call invokes the matching algorithm---an
operation that may be expensive for large models. JSBML does not store the
results of applying the matching algorithm, because a change in the model's
structure could also change these results and lead to an inconsistency.  For
models that contain multiple \AlgebraicRule objects, it is instead more
efficient to compute the matching once by invoking
\OverdeterminationValidator. Please see the documentation for \AlgebraicRule
for more details.
