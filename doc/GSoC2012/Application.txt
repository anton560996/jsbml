Application for the Google Summer of Code 2012
==============================================


FAQ of GSoC 2012: http://www.google-melange.com/gsoc/document/show/gsoc_program/google/gsoc2012/faqs#mentoring_apply

Deadline: March 9, 2012.

1. Description of the organization

JSBML is an international community-driven open-source project striving to attain 
a full implementation of the SBML standard (Systems Biology Markup Language) in 
Javaª. Currently, the consortium of developers consists of the University of 
Tuebingen, Germany, the EMBL European Bioinformatics Institute (EBML-EBI), Hinxton,
UK, and the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, CA, USA.
Being a community project, other institutions are welcome to join the consortium.
Details about the project, the latest version, and its aims can be found at 
http://sbml.org/Software/JSBML. Twice per year face-to-face meetings of all people
involved in the development of JSBML are organized as part of the COMBINE initiative
(see http://co.mbine.org). Furthermore, two mailing lists and regular phone and 
internet conferences ensure a continuous development and compliance of JSBML. All 
institutions jointly hold the copyright of the project.


2. Why is your organization applying to participate in Google Summer of Code 2012? 
   What do you hope to gain by participating?

The young field of systems biology is a rapidly evolving and highly dynamic area of
research in the life sciences. On the long term, an open source project such as JSBML
can only be successful with a broad acceptance within the scientific community and a
likewise support of volunteering students, PhD candidates, and software developers.
Catching up with the latest requirements and developments plays an important role. 
Furthermore, the project JSBML is based on a collection of well-defined specifications
of the standard SBML and provides an implementation of the standard in Java.
Ongoing research and further development of the underlying standard requires a 
continuous development of implementing software as well. A sophisticated and elaborated
implementation of SBML can be used for numerous in-silico experiments and computational
modeling of biochemical processes, hence catalyze the progress in systems biology.
Thereby, the amount of work for catching up with new SBML specifications and other
developments should not be underestimated. JSBML can only continue to be a flexible 
library for SBML if highly motivated people support it.

The Google Summer of Code provides a platform for bringing together well established 
developers of JSBML and young students from many different countries. This will be a 
great chance for the recruitment of new volunteers. 

    
3. Did your organization participate in past Google Summer of Codes? 
   If so, please summarize your involvement and the successes and challenges of your 
   participation.
   
JSBML is a very young project, of which the first version has been published last year. 
There was no participation of the consortium in the Google Summer of Code yet. This will
be the first time.


4. If your organization has not previously participated in Google Summer of Code, 
   have you applied in the past? If so, for what year(s)?
   
There was no application for participation of the JSBML consortium until now.


5. What Open Source Initiative approved license(s) does your project use?

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE Version 2.1, February 1999

    
6. What is the URL for your Ideas page?

TODO:
http://sbml.org/Software/JSBML/Ideas_GSoC2012


7. What is the main development mailing list for your organization?

For public discussion: jsbml-development@caltech.edu
For discussion with the core development team only: jsbml-team@caltech.edu


8. What is the main IRC channel for your organization?

There is none yet.


9. Does your organization have an application template you would like to see students use? 
   If so, please provide it now.

None yet.


10. Who will be your backup organization administrator?

Dr. Andreas DrŠger, Nicolas Rodriguez, and Dr. Michal Hucka


11. What criteria did you use to select your mentors for this year's program? Please be as
    specific as possible.

The mentors selected are the current core developers of JSBML.

12. What is your plan for dealing with disappearing students?


TODO


13. What is your plan for dealing with disappearing mentors?

All JSBML core developers can act as a substitutional mentor to fill the gap.


14. What steps will you take to encourage students to interact with your project's community
    before, during and after the program?

TODO


15. Are you a new organization who has a Googler or other organization to vouch for you?
    If so, please list their name(s) here.

TODO


16. Are you an established or larger organization who would like to vouch for a new organization
    applying this year? If so, please list their name(s) here.

No, the JSBML development consortium is a young group of researchers. 


    EXPLANATION FROM GOOGLE:
    "A few notes on the mentoring organization application:

    If you take a look at the program timeline, we've left about a week and a half for students to 
    get to know you before submitting their applications. It is critical that it be obvious how 
    students should reach you to discuss applying to your organization; plan to link this information 
    from your Ideas list at the very least.
    The email addresses associated with the Google Account information provided during application 
    process will be used as the primary mode of contact by Google throughout the program, e.g. the 
    email address which we will use to subscribe you to the Google Summer of Code mentors/admins-only 
    mailing list.
    In addition to the application, the mentoring organization will be required to sign a Mentoring 
    Organization Participation Agreement.

    
    3. What is an Ideas list?

An Ideas list should be a list of suggested student projects. This list is meant to introduce contributors to 
your project's needs and to provide inspiration to would-be student applicants. It is useful to classify each 
idea as specifically as possible, e.g. "must know Python" or "easier project; good for a student with more 
limited experience with C++." If your organization plans to provide an application template, it would be 
good to include it on your Ideas list.

Keep in mind that your Ideas list should be a starting point for student applications; we've heard from past 
mentoring organization participants that some of their best student projects are those that greatly 
expanded on a proposed idea or were blue-sky proposals not mentioned on the Ideas list at all. A link to a 
bug tracker for your open source organization is NOT an ideas list."

    Project: Validation of SBML models and documents

*** Available for JSBML ***

Brief explanation: 
  To facilitate the development of the life sciences from a descriptive to a predictive field of research, 
  mathematical modeling playes a central role. Creating models of cellular or other  biochemical processes 
  requires a well-suited software implementation. The project JSBML is a community-driven approach to 
  implement a standard Javaª library for the recent research in the young field in systems biology. 
  JSBML is a Javaª library that implements the SBML standard (Systems Biology Markup Language).
  SBML itself is a XML-based language (eXtensible Markup Language). In this project, a validation routine
  will be developed that checks whether an SBML file is syntactically (and semantically) valid.

Expected results:
  JSBML will be extended with a package that allows users and third-party software to check whether its
  data structures fulfill the requirements and satisfy all restrictions defined in the SBML specifications.

Knowledge Prerequisite:
  Javaª programming. XML parsing, and biochemical modeling would be of advantage.

Any of these are optional but not all of them.

Skill level: medium to high.

Mentor: Dr. Andreas DrŠger, Nicolas Rodriguez
