\item[Why does the class \texttt{LocalParameter} not inherit from
\texttt{Parameter}?]
\index{parameter!\texttt{LocalParameter}}
\index{parameter!\texttt{Parameter}}
The reason is the Boolean
\index{Boolean}
attribute \texttt{constant}, which is present in
\index{constant}
\index{parameter!\texttt{constant}}
\texttt{Parameter} and can be set to \texttt{false}. A parameter in the meaning
of SBML is not a constant, it might be some system variable
\index{JSBML!variable@\texttt{Variable}}
and can therefore be the subject of \texttt{Rule}s,
\index{rule}
\texttt{Event}s\index{event!\texttt{Event}}, \texttt{InitialAssignment}s
\index{InitialAssignment@\texttt{InitialAssignment}}
and so on, i.e., all instances of \texttt{Assignment},
\index{JSBML!assignment@\texttt{Assignment}}
whereas a \texttt{LocalParameter} is defined as a constant quantity that never
changes its value during the evaluation of a model\index{model}. It would
therefore only be possible to let \texttt{Parameter} inherit from
\texttt{LocalParameter} but this could lead to a semantic misinterpretation.
