# JSBML-1.3.1


We are pleased to announce the release of JSBML-1.3.1, which is now available for download from GitHub (above) and from [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jsbml/files/jsbml/1.3).

JSBML is a community-driven project to create a free, open-source, pure Java library for reading, writing, and manipulating [SBML](http://sbml.org) files and data streams. It is an alternative to the mixed Java/native code-based interface provided in [libSBML](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML).

For more details, please visit the JSBML project home page:

<http://sbml.org/Software/JSBML>

The main new feature in this release is the support for SBML Level 3 Version 2 and the development of the offline validator. We have also started to write some converters that transform SBML documents. In particular, a converter that expands function definitions that was requested several times by our community. Some very good progress were made on the offline validator, you can get a [detailled report](/sbmlteam/jsbml/wiki/Offline-validator-status) of what is left to be done in a separate wiki page. Since last release we made the offline validator more user friendly by provided error messages similar to libsbml with a first part that explain the specification and a second part that describe the element and why it failed the rule.

You can find a detailed list of the user-visible new features and bug fixes since JSBML version 1.2 on the [NEWS](NEWS.md) file.

Thank you for your interest and support of JSBML and SBML in general.

## The JSBML team.
