# JSBML-1.3


We are pleased to announce the release of JSBML-1.3, which is now available for download from GitHub (above) and from [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jsbml/files/jsbml/1.3).

JSBML is a community-driven project to create a free, open-source, pure Java library for reading, writing, and manipulating [SBML](http://sbml.org) files and data streams. It is an alternative to the mixed Java/native code-based interface provided in [libSBML](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML).

For more details, please visit the JSBML project home page:

<http://sbml.org/Software/JSBML>

The main new feature in this release is the support for SBML Level 3 Version 2 and the development of the offline validator.

Although we provide the main download files from GitHub, we will continue to distribute the releases from SourceForge until we develop a suitable release replacement scheme using either GitHub or sbml.org.

You can find a detailed list of the user-visible new features and bug fixes since JSBML version 1.1 on the [NEWS](NEWS.md) file.

Thank you for your interest and support of JSBML and SBML in general.

## The JSBML team.
