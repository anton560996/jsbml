# JSBML-1.4


We are pleased to announce the release of JSBML-1.4, which is now available for download from GitHub (above) and from [SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/projects/jsbml/files/jsbml/1.4).

JSBML is a community-driven project to create a free, open-source, pure Java library for reading, writing, and manipulating [SBML](http://sbml.org) files and data streams. It is an alternative to the mixed Java/native code-based interface provided in [libSBML](http://sbml.org/Software/libSBML).

For more details, please visit the JSBML project home page:

<http://sbml.org/Software/JSBML>

The main new feature in this release is the development of the offline validator. We have also started to write some converters that transform SBML documents. Some progress were made on the offline validator, you can get a [detailed report](https://github.com/sbmlteam/jsbml/wiki/Offline-validator-status) of what is left to be done in a separate wiki page. 

You can find a detailed list of the user-visible new features and bug fixes since JSBML version 1.3 on the [NEWS](NEWS.md) file.

Thank you for your interest and support of JSBML and SBML in general.

## The JSBML team.
