JSBML-1.2-beta1
-------------------------

We are pleased to announce the release of JSBML-1.2-beta1, which is now
available for download from

https://sourceforge.net/projects/jsbml/files/jsbml/1.2-beta1

JSBML is a community-driven project to create a free, open-source, pure
Java library for reading, writing, and manipulating SBML files and data
streams. It is an alternative to the mixed Java/native code-based
interface provided in libSBML.

The main new feature in this release is the support for SBML Level 3 
Version 2 (RC1). This involved a bit of changes in the class hierarchy of
JSBML as now every SBase can have an id and a name. For compatibility
reasons, we did not change the NamedSBase interface, so not every SBase is
a NamedSBase. Only SBML elements that had an id and a name before SBML L3V2
will extend NamedSBase. So when implementing support for SBML L3V2 you
should try when possible to stop using NamedSBase and just use SBase
instead. Same holds for UniqueNamedSBase and UniqueSId. If you were using
the UniqueNamedSBase class, you should try to use UniqueSId instead.
As part of the upgrade to support SBML L3V2, users should consider checking
the way they access InitialAssignment, Rule and EventAssignment as often
the methods are making use of the 'variable' or 'symbol' attribute instead
of the id attribute.

We have upgraded the minimum JDK requirement to 1.7 for this release, to be
able to use the latest versions of the third party libraries we are using.
And as the number of third party libraries having JDK 1.8 as minimum
requirement increases, we might increase the minimum JDK requirement of
JSBML to 1.8 for next year releases. Please let us know in advance if you
think it will be a problem for you.

The toString() method of most classes has been replaced by a generic 
method so you might find some changes in the output produced by the JSBML
classes. One method we did not change for now is ASTNode.toString() as it
could have a lot of side effects. As part of the upgrade to SBML L3V2 and
JSBML 1.2, we advice users to make sure they are using ASTNode.toFormula()
when they want to show/store the infix formula representation of an ASTNode
and do not rely on the toString() method for that. Don't hesitate to
provide us with some feedback about this changes. We tried to keep any
significantly different toString method under a different name, starting 
with 'print' and followed by the class name, for example Unit.printUnit()
will produce the same output as the Unit.toString() method in jsbml-1.1.
 
Since last release, we have moved the source code repository of JSBML to
github.com. Although we do provide the main download files in GitHub, we 
are still using for this release the files section of SourceForge to
provides all of the download files until we work on a replacement either
on GitHub or on sbml.org.

At the end of this message, you can find a detailed list of the
user-visible new features and bug fixes since 1.1.


Thank you for your interest and support of JSBML and SBML in general.

The JSBML team.
