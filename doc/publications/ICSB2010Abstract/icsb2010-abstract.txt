The XML-based Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) constitutes the de-facto
standard file format to store and exchange biochemical network models, and is supported
by more than 180 software packages to date. Much of this success is due to its clearly defined specifications and the supporting libSBML library. 

LibSBML provides many methods for manipulating and
validating SBML files through its Application Programing Interface (API).
Originally written in C and C++, libSBML also provides automatically generated 
language bindings to many other programming environments including MATLAB,
Java, Python, and many more. However, the platform independence of Java is lost when
it is used with libSBML, due to the wrapped C code. Hence, development of libSBML-based Java 
applications is difficult. Furthermore, the libSBML API and type hierarchy are not as intuitive
since they are not designed directly for Java. 

For these reasons, the SBML community decided that
an entirely Java-based library for SBML should be developed.
This work comprised the joined efforts of several groups and here we present 
the JSBML project, which is freely available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsbml. 
Its aim is to provide SBML parsers and writers that map all SBML elements to a 
flexible and extended type hierarchy.
Where possible, efforts were made to attain 100 % API compatibility with the libSBML 
Java API to facilitate a switch from one API to the other, if desired.
Currently, there are no plans to re-implement some of the more complex 
functions of libSBML, since these would be made available in JSBML via webservices. These 
functions include consistency checking, validation and the conversion between different 
SBML levels and versions.

Currently, JSBML supports all constructs for SBML up to the latest Level 3
Version 1 draft proposal, including an API to add SBML extensions.

In summary, JSBML is a young, ongoing software project that provides 
comprehensive and entirely Java-based data structures to read, write, and 
manipulate SBML files. Its layered architecture allows for the creation of 
Java-webstart applications and CellDesigner plug-ins based on stand-alone 
programs with very little effort. One program, SBMLsqueezer 1.3, that uses 
JSBML has already been released and many others are planned.
