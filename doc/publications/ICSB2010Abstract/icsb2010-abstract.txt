The XML-based Systems Biology markup language (SBML) constitutes the de-facto
standard file format to store and exchange biochemical network models: more than
180 programs support this file format (23 December 2009).
The clearly defined specifications and the libSBML library are reasons for this
success. The libSBML library provides many methods for reading, writing and
validating SBML files through its Application Programing Interface (API).

Originally written in C and C++, libSBML also provides automatically generated 
language bindings to many other programing environments such as MATLABTM,
JavaTM, Python, and many more. However, when working with Java, due to the
underlying wrapped C code, all programs based on libSBML become
platform dependent. In this way, it is quite hard to develop Java applications
based on libSBML that would work on any system where Java is supported as under some
operating systems, installation and compilation of libSBML can be difficult. Furthermore,
the generated libSBML Java API is not as natural as if we wrote and design it directly 
for Java, the same apply to the type hierarchy of libSBML.

For these reasons, the SBML community decided in a survey in May 2009 that the
development of an entirely Java-based library for SBML should be developed.
Several groups that had already started to work on a Java library to support SBML
joined their effort and here, we present the JSBML project, which is freely
available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/jsbml.  Its aim is to provide SBML
parsers and writers that map all SBML elements to a flexible and extended type
hierarchy, which can directly be used for computation and complex operations.
Whenever possible we try to keep a 100% API compatibility 
with the libsbml Java API to easy the effort of projects to switch from one to the other.
But we are not planning at the moment to re-implement some of the complex part of libsbml,
these would be made available in JSBML via webservices for example, like consistency check 
and validation or convertion between different SBML levels and versions.

Currently, JSBML supports all constructs for SBML up to the latest Level 3
Version 1 draft proposal including an API to add SBML extensions.

Summarizing, JSBML is a young, ongoing software project that provide a comprehensive and
entirely Java-based data structures to read, write, and manipulate SBML files.
Its layered architecture allows for the creation of Java-webstart applications and 
CellDesigner plug-ins based on stand-alone programs with very little effort. 
One program, SBMLsqueezer 1.3, that use JSBML has already been released and some others 
are on the way to use JSBML.
