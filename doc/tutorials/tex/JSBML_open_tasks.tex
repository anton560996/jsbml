\begin{itemize}
\item JSBML does not yet provide a stand-alone validator for SBML. It currently
uses the online validator for SBML.
\item The support for SBML Level~3\index{SBML!Level~3} should be completed by
implementing the extension packages.\index{SBML!extension packages}
\item The \texttt{toSBML()}\index{SBase@\texttt{SBase}!\texttt{toSBML()}}
methods in \texttt{SBase} are missing.
\item Constructors and methods with namespaces are not yet provided.
\item The libSBML compatibility module\index{libSBML!compatibility module}
needs to be fully implemented.
\item Also the \texttt{android} module is not ready yet.
\item A more general implementation for ontology access and manipulation in
order to access other ontologies than just the SBO. See, for instance, the work
of \citet{Courtot2011a} for details.\index{Ontology}
