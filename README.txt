0. FOREWORD
======================================================================

Article citations are crucial to our academic careers.  If you use
JSBML and you publish papers about your software, we ask that you
please cite the JSBML paper:

  Draeger, A., Rodriguez, N., Dumousseau, M., Doerr, A., Wrzodek, C., 
  Le Novere, N., Zell, A., and Hucka M. (2011) JSBML: a flexible Java
  library for working with SBML. Bioinformatics, 27(15):2167â€“2168.


1. WHAT'S NEW IN THIS RELEASE?
======================================================================

Please see the file NEWS.txt for more information about recent changes
in JSBML.  For a complete list of changes, please see the revision 
logs in the source code repository at 

  http://sbml.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/jsbml/


2. QUICK START
======================================================================

3. INTRODUCTION
======================================================================

4. DETAILED INSTRUCTIONS FOR CONFIGURING AND INSTALLING JSBML
======================================================================

5. REPORTING BUGS AND OTHER PROBLEMS
======================================================================

We invite you to report bugs and other problems using the issue
tracker for JSBML on SourceForge.  The following URL will take you
there directly:

  https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=279608&atid=1186776

You can also ask questions on the 'jsbml-development' and
'sbml-interoperability' mailing lists, either over email or using the
web forum interface (see below).  This may even have advantages, such
as that other people may also have experienced the issue and offer a
workaround more quickly than the JSBML developers can respond.

Finally, if you cannot get a timely response from the resources above,
you may contact the main JSBML developers directly by sending email to
'jsbml-team@caltech.edu'.


6. MAILING LISTS
======================================================================

There are two kinds of mailing lists available: normal discussion
lists for humans, and a SVN change notification list.

Discussion lists
----------------

All discussion lists, their web interfaces and their RSS feeds are at

                       http://sbml.org/Forums/

If you use SBML, we urge you to sign up for sbml-announce, the SBML
announcements mailing list.  It is a low-volume, broadcast-only list.

If you use JSBML, we also encourage you to subscribe to or monitor via
RSS the 'jsbml-development' list, where people discuss the development
and use of JSBML.  Being a member of libsbml-development will enable
you to keep in touch with the latest developments in JSBML as well as
to ask questions and share your experiences with fellow developers and
users of JSBML.

We also encourage you to subscribe to or monitor via RSS the
'sbml-interoperability' list, where people discuss the development,
use, and interoperability of software that supports SBML, including
JSBML.

SVN notification
----------------

If you are obtaining your JSBML files from SVN, you may wish to
subscribe to the mailing list jsbml-svn, to be apprised of changes to
the SVN repository as soon as they are committed.  You can join the
list by visiting the following URL:

  https://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/jsbml-svn
