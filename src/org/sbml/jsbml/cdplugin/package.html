    This package provides a bridge between the plug-in API of the 
    graphical pathway editor CellDesigner and JSBML. In particular,
    this package provides a reader and a writer that interconvert
    all data structures of both concepts. In this way, providing a
    plug-in for CellDesigner for an application that has originally
    been developed based on JSBML becomes very easy.
