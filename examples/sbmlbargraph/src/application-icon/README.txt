			   SBML Bar Graph icons
	Some miscellaneous notes about the files in this directory.

		      2012-03-31 <mhucka@caltech.edu>

I created the Windows icon file "SBML Bar Graph application icon Windows.ico"
using an application called "@icon sushi" available from 

   http://www.towofu.net/soft/e-aicon.php

This application lets you combine multiple individual icon files (each of
which has a different size) into one .ico file.  The procedure is simple:
drag the individual icon image files into the @icon sushi window, then use
the "Save as multiple icon" command in the File menu.

I combined the following icon files into the .ico file:

  sbml sb only 16x16.png
  sbml sb only 24x24.png
  sbml bar graph application icon 32x32.png
  sbml bar graph application icon 48x48.png
  sbml bar graph application icon 64x64.png
  sbml bar graph application icon 128x128.png
  sbml bar graph application icon 256x256.png
