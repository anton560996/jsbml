JSBML
=====

<img align="right" src=".graphics/jsbml_logo_128.png"> JSBML is a community-driven project to create a free, open-source, pure Java library for reading, writing, and manipulating SBML files and data streams. It is an alternative to the mixed Java/native code-based interface provided in libSBML.

✺ How to get started with JSBML
-------------------------------

Please see the user manual at http://sbml.org/Software/JSBML/docs.

If you use JSBML, we encourage you to subscribe to or monitor via RSS the [jsbml-development](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jsbml-development) mailing list/web forum, where people discuss the development and use of JSBML.  Being a member of [jsbml-development](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jsbml-development) will enable you to keep in touch with the latest developments in JSBML as well as to ask questions and share your experiences with fellow developers and users of JSBML.

⁇ Getting Help
------------

JSBML is under active development by a distributed team.  If you find bugs, please report them using the tracker; if you have any questions, please post them on one of the discussion groups or contact the developers directly:

* *Bug reports*: [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/sbmlteam/jsbml/issues).

* *Forum for JSBML*: [jsbml-development](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jsbml-development)

* *Forum for general SBML software interoperability discussions*: [sbml-interoperability](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sbml-interoperability)

* *Main development team mailing list*: [jsbml-team@caltech.edu](mailto:jsbml-team@caltech.edu)

_What is the difference between [jsbml-development](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/jsbml-development) and [sbml-interoperability](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sbml-interoperability)?_  The former is specifically for discussions about JSBML, while the latter is appropriate for discussions involving SBML software interoperability in general, including (but not limited to) JSBML and its use in other software.

If you use SBML, we also urge you to sign up for [sbml-announce](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/sbml-announce), the SBML announcements mailing list.  It is a low-volume, broadcast-only list.
