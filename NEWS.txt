	       JSBML NEWS -- History of user-visible changes

======================================================================
Version 1.0-rc1 (xx-xx-2012)
======================================================================

* New Features:
  
  - Filter method on TreeNodeWithChangeSupport, which allows for
    recursive queries in the entire data structure.

  - Validation check for e-mail addresses in Creator.
  
  - A quick Hash-based search method to access elements in a model
    based on their identifier. In the same way, any SBase can be
    found in the SBMLDocument based on its metaId.

* Bug Fixes:

  - JSBML could not write negative infinity into SBML files correctly.
  
  - Meike Aichele removed in TreeNodeChangeEvent the event spacialDimension, 
    because there is already a spatialDimension-event, which means 
    exactly the same
    
  - The units of formulae containing Advogadro's number could not
    be derived because in the UnitsCompiler a UnitDefinition object 
    was created with undefined level/version configuration. Furhtermore,
    there was a bug in the method containsUndeclaredUnits() in ASTNode.
    
  - Detected and fixed a source of possible NullPointerExceptions within 
    the hashCode method in ASTNode.
    
  - Improved the units derivation: There were multiple problems in 
    re-scaling and merging of units and also when determining the actual
    unit of a species.
      
  - There was a bug in KineticLaw that prevented a correct iteration
    through all child elements: Instead of looking at the 
    listOfLocalParameters it did return the math element twice (if there
    was one).
    
  - When cloning entire models or SBMLDocuments, JSBML also did assign
    the identical TreeNodeChangeListeners to the new data structure. This
    could lead to unexpected behavior because listeners were receiving
    change events from data structures to which these have not been 
    explicitely added by a user.
    
  - Cloning also caused problems because in some cases the recursive
    method that registers all local parameters and other entities with
    an id did in some cases not do a full recursion. Hence, some entities
    could not be found in the model later on when searching for a certain
    id.
    
  - QuantityWithUnit did not fire update events when changing its value
    because of an incorrect comparison of the previous and the new value.
    
  - Detected a bug that made it impossible to set a kinetic law with an 
    exisiting list of local parameters as the new kinetic law in a 
    different reaction. JSBML always complained that all local parameters
    were already registered. This was the case for the previous model to
    which the kinetic law belonged. Hence, it was necessary to unregister
    all local parameters first.
    
  - Subsequent registration and unregistration of local parameters did 
    not work. In case of reactions it was assumed that the kinetic law 
    that was to be added to some SBML subtree had already a parent SBML 
    element (this could be null). Furthermore, when trying to unregister 
    local parameters in a kinetic law, the put method was called on the
    map between ids and local parameters, instead of the remove method.

======================================================================
Version 0.8-rc1 (xx-xx-2011)
======================================================================

* New Features:

  - NamedSBase has now the new method isIdMandatory in order to check
    whether the identifier of this element must be defined in the SBML
    representation.

  - The SBMLReader can now be used in connection with a 
    TreeNodeChangeListener. This allows users to keep track about the
    parsing process of XML files.
  
  - The new interface TreeNodeWithChangeSupport separates manipulation
    of change listeners from SBase, allowing multiple implementations.

  - The JavaDoc has been extended: It now also includes a statement
    when ever a method might throw a PropertyNotAvailableException.
    This class was called PropertyNotAvailableError before. In order
    to avoid confusion with Java Errors, this class has been renamed.
    Also the super type XMLError has been renamed to XMLException in
    order to come closer to the default Java naming convention in
    JSBML.
  
  - ASTNode has now a userObject attribute through which any 
    computation result or other additional information can be stored
    in the tree.
  
  - Restructured the extension package: There is now one extra 
    directory including a specialized source folder for each extension. 
    The core does no longer contain the ext package. Besides the source
    folder, there is also an extra doc folder that contains the 
    description of the type hierarchy of the implementation for this
    package.
    
  - Data structures for the spatial extension are implemented.
  
  - When accessing the i-th child of an AbstractSBase, it is no longer
    necessary to sort all extension packages as these are now 
    maintained in a sorted data structure.
  
  - The compile method in ASTNode has become more efficient now by
    restructuring its case distinctions.
  
  - Implemented the hashCode method for all elements belonging to the
    hierarchical SBML data structure (SBase, Annotation, ASTNode 
    etc.).
  
  - In order to get closer to the Java package structure, the change 
    listener for SBML objects is now located in the package 
    org.sbml.jsbml.util package. For the sake of more similarity to
    standard Java classes and a greater flexibility, the 
    SBaseChangedListener has been renamed to TreeNodeChangeListener
    and now extends the PropertyChangeListener in the package 
    java.beans. The same holds for the corresponding
    SBaseChangedEvent that is now called TreeNodeChangeEvent and also
    located in the package org.sbml.jsbml.util. Furthermore, all 
    elements of the SBML tree, including annotations, ASTNodes etc.
    now make use of change events and notify their listeners, which
    are now organized in a list instead of a set to make sure that
    they are always called in the same order. The management of these
    listeners is now performed in AbstractTreeNode, the new super 
    class for all recursive elements in JSBML. Thanks to Sarah Rachel
    Müller vom Hagen to support this effort.
  
  - Notes, annotations, and extension packages are now part of the tree
    representation of the JSBML data structure.
    
  - The new super class AnnotationElement has been introduced to gather
    all those elements that can be used to annotate instances of SBase.
      
  - The new Type AbstractTreeNode implements basic recursive functions
    and is now used as the new super class for ASTNode, AbstractSBase,
    the new type AnnotationElement, and XMLToken (as the super class of
    XMLNode). In this way, recursion and iteration over child elements
    within the SBML data structure now follow a unified structure and
    can be accessed uniquely within all such elements, including 
    annotations and extensions. Furthermore, the new interface
    TreeNodeWithChangeSupport that is extended by SBase and 
    AbstractTreeNode gathers methods to add, remove, and notify listeners
    about changes within the data structure (such as adding, removing
    or exchanging child nodes, or change of any attributes).
    
  - A simple implementation of AbstractTreeNode, the class 
    TreeNodeAdapter has been implemented that contains some methods
    also present in the interface MutableTreeNode. However, it does not
    fully implement this interface because there are also some methods
    that are not suitable for JSBML purposes. The TreeNodeAdapter works
    as a wrapper class for elements that are part of the SBML data 
    hierarchy but that do not implement the TreeNode interface. With this
    adapter, it is possible to include the list of Creators within a 
    history that is not a ListOf object, or the list of CVTerms in an
    annotation in the hierarchy.
    
  - Sebastian Fröhlich provided some contributions to the parser for the 
    SBML level 3 layout extension package. JSBML now  supports experimental
    reading for this package. The full stable API for reading/writing of
    SBML level 3 packages is planned for the next release of JSBML.

  - The SBMLReader now follows the factory pattern by providing static
    methods to directly read SBML content from Files, InputStreams, or
    Strings. Thanks to Martin Gräßlin for this idea in tracker issue 
    #3300433.

  - JSBML now provides a Maven script file. Thanks to Igor Rodchenkov
    for contributing this file.

  - Where necessary, initDefaults has been complemented with an 
    additional method, for which the level/version combination can be
    directly specified, i.e., it is now possible for those elements to
    set their defaults as these would be for the specified 
    level/version combination.

  - A basic check to avoid setting the same meta identifier more than
    once has been implemented. It maintains a set of metaIds on the
    SBMLDocument. Thanks to Stefan Hoops for making clear that such a 
    check is mandatory.
    
  - A check for duplicate identifiers has been implemented. JSBML now
    registers all elements that might have an identifier in hashes
    mapping the id to the object itself. Different rules depending on
    the specifications of the levels and versions of SBML ensure that
    only allowable identifiers can be accepted. To this end, the new
    interface UniqueNamedSBase tags all those elements whose id is
    intended to be unique within one model.
        
  - When adding an element with undefined Level/Version combination
    or at least with undefined Version to an element whose L/V 
    configuration has been defined, JSBML now recursively updates this
    configuration for the child element. In case of differing L/V
    configurations an exception will be thrown on adding the element.
    
* Bug Fixes:

  - Corrected mistakes in the org.sbml.jsbml.util.Maths class, where
    some trigonometric functions were incorrectly calculated.

  - When writing SBML Level 1 the name attribute (which has become the
    id attribute in later SBML versions) was never written because JSBML
    uses the id only as an internal representation. The check for 
    Level 1 name attributes was not correct.

  - In SBML Level 1 MathML code was written in KineticLaws although
    in this SBML version formulas are represented in infix notation only.

  - When creating a Parameter object using the constructor that takes
    a LocalParameter as its only argument, a call to setConstant(true)
    was always performed, irrespective of the fact that for Level = 1
    models this method throws a PropertyNotAvailableError. Thanks to
    Sarah R. Müller vom Hagen for reporting this problem.

  - [Tracker issue #3323886]: The units of Species were not derived
    correctly because if the units were not explicitly defined, the method
    getDerivedUnitsInstance() always returned the predefined unit 
    "substance", or null for models in Level 3. Now it considers the
    surrounding compartment, the hasOnlySubstanceUnits, and spatialSizeUnits
    attributes depending on the Level/Version configuration.

  - Cloning of SBMLDocuments was not done correctly: The set of already 
    existing metaIds was initialized after adding the model to the document.
    In the mean time, there could already be access to this set. 

  - When reading SBML content from a file or writing JSBML data structures
    as SBML to a file, the SBMLReader/Writer did not close streams after 
    finishing. This caused that sometimes files could not be opened by other
    programs although writing was already done. Unfortunately, by correcting
    this bug, an IOException needs to be thrown, but previously, a 
    FileNotFoundException was already sufficient. Hence, users need to catch
    a different exception now when reading/writing SBML.

  - Renamed the getters for Creator and ModifiedDates in History to
    getListOfCreators() and getListOfModifiedDates (before it was spelled
    without "Of", for the sake of having equal names for all such getters.

  - If the Level/Version combination was not set, the identifier of
    NamedSBases was sometimes not written to an SBML file.

  - [Tracker issue #3300430]: In some condition, the JVM was not checking
    the type of an Object before adding it to a typed variable which later
    lead to some ClassCastException that prevented jsbml to save some 
    models. Thanks to Martin Graesslin to report the bugs alongside some 
    unit tests and to help resolved it.
    
  - [Tracker issue #3300490] : The method SBase.getNotesString() was 
    returning null instead of the empty string, as stated in the java 
    documentation. This has been corrected and the empty String is returned
    now. Thanks to Martin Graesslin to report the bugs alongside some 
    unit tests.
       
  - The SBML level 1 rules were incorrectly read, now when the 'type' 
    attribute is set to 'rate', a RateRule is properly created.     

  - The SubModel utility class was fixed and an example of how to use it 
    added.

  - Corrected the clone method for listOf objects. The typeOfList was
    not set in the clone so it was not possible to save a model that contain
    a cloned list.
    
  - [Tracker item #3306135] : the handling to the number NaN (NotANumber) has
    been improved and the correct mathML element is created when saving the
    formula to XML. 
  
  - The attribute denominator on level1v2 SpeciesReferences was never read.
    Thanks to the numerus models in the SBML Test Suite to help us detecting 
    this problem.
  
* Known issues :

  - ?? The support for the mathML elements notanumber and infinity is not 
    complete. ?? NaN not read properly from formula !
  
  - Reading of more than one RDF Description elements in the RDF annotation 
    block (the official SBML annotation scheme) is not supported at the 
    moment. Planned for the next major release. 
  
======================================================================
Version 0.8-b2 (18-04-2011)
======================================================================

* New Features:

  - The new interface CallableSBase ensures that only instances of this
    type may be referenced in ASTNodes. In this way, it is no longer
    possible to refer to Events from ASTNodes.
    
  - Additional type of error: abstract PropertyError with its two sub-
    types PropertyNotAvailableError and PropertyUndefinedError. The 
    PropertyNotAvailableError one indicates that a certain property
    of an SBase is not defined for its current Level/Version 
    combination, whereas the latter one indicates that the value 
    belonging to a mandatory property, for which there is no default
    value has not been defined. At least in the Trigger class, 
    PropertyUndefinedErrors are now thrown when attempting to access
    the value of the persistent or initialValue attribute for models
    with Level >= 3 and an undeclared value. Thanks to Roland Keller
    and Lucian Smith for pointing out this necessity.    

* Bug Fixes:

  - The class Maths, a compilation of useful mathematical functions,
    provided an implementation of the factorial function that took
    a double as its argument. However, for this purpose, the Gamma
    function must be implemented. We changed this function to take 
    integer values only.

  - A NullPointerException could occur when deriving the unit of an
    expression containing a call to the factorial function. Thanks
    to Roland Keller for reporting this. 

  - [Tracker issue #3208887] : When trying to access the previously
    set value for  UseValuesFromTriggerTime it was possible that a
    NullPointerException could occur due to the attempt to clone this
    element. This has been fixed. Thanks to Sebastian Fröhlich for 
    reporting this.

  - [Tracker issue #3208903] : Priority elements were 
    properly read and written. Thanks to Sebastian Fröhlich for 
    reporting this.

  - [Tracker issue #3204275] : It was impossible to set the size of a 
    compartment for models in Level 3 if the spatial dimensions was 
    undefined, i.e., NaN. Since it is only prohibited to set the size 
    if the dimensions equal 0, we provided another test in the set 
    method in Compartment to allow for this.
  
  - Corrected a typo in the method SBO.getAntisenseRNA(), the method was
    always returning -1. It is now returning the correct value (317), thanks
    to Anushya Muruganujan for reporting this.

  - [Tracker issue #3175906] : Removed plenty of unused methods in the 
    Annotation class that were dealing with writing the annotation as XML. 
    Everything is handle now in the stax SBMLWriter.
    The getAnnotationString method was not present in the SBase interface, 
    it is now added and should be the only method used to get the Annotation
    as XML. 
    
  - [Tracker issue #3175911] : compartment.spatialDimensions type changed 
    to double to be consistent with the SBML level 3 specifications, as a 
    consequence the return type of the getSpatialDimensions as been changed.
    
  - [Tracker issue #3176548] : id containing underscores were not parsed
    properly by the infix formula parser, this is now fix and any valid SId
    should work. Thanks to Goksel Misirli for reporting this.
    
  - [Tracker issue #3175833] : annotation tags were not properly closed when
    a mathML element was present on the same element.
    Thanks to Goksel Misirli for reporting this.  
  
  - A new interface, CallableSBase, was introduced to encompass all the 
    different SBML elements that can be referenced inside a mathML 'ci'
    element. As a consequence, some methods signature have changed.

  - [Tracker issue #3175833] : in some cases, an empty annotation was 
    written if a metaid was defined. Some methods were added to the 
    Annotation class to test which part of the annotation is defined.

  - [Tracker issue #3196284] : the unit exponent was incorrectly always read
    as an integer. This has been corrected and if the level of the model is 
    3, the exponent is read as a double. 

  - [Tracker issue #3196638] : the message constraint was not properly read,
    it was stored in the notes instead of the message ! This is now 
    corrected, thanks to the person who reported that.

  - Corrected several bugs in the SBMLValidator and implemented properly all
    the classes related to SBMLdocument.checkConsistency() so that is works 
    as expected.
    
  - [Tracker issue #3199792] : localParameter were not parsed correctly in 
    SBML level 3. Thanks for the persons who reported it.
      
  - [Tracker issue #3216183] : all the XML elements that were belonging to
    the RDF namespace were sent to a parser that understood only the 
    specific SBML RDF annotations. This as been fixed and we can now have
    some RDF elements anywhere in the annotation.   
      
* Known issues :

  - SBML level 1 rules when the 'type' attribute is equal to 'rate' are 
    created as AssignmentRule instead of RateRule.
  
  - The support for the mathML elements notanumber and infinity is not 
    complete.
  
  - Reading of more than one RDF Description elements in the RDF annotation 
    block (the official SBML annotation scheme) is not supported at the 
    moment. 
  
============================================================================
Version 0.8-b1 (04-02-2011)
============================================================================

This the first beta release of JSBML 0.8, JSBML is a community-driven
project to create a free, open-source, pure Java library for reading,
writing, and manipulating SBML files and data streams. It is an
alternative to the mixed Java/native code-based interface provided in 
libSBML.

For more details, please visit http://sbml.org/Software/JSBML

* Bug Fixes:
  - [Tracker issue #3137967]
    Namespaces in the sbml element were incorrectly parsed, some known 
    namespaces like html were not kept for examples. This is fixed, thanks 
    to Paulo Maia for reporting this.

* Known issues:
  - problem of output indentation for notes, when there is several top level 
    elements.
  
  - the method SBMLDocument.checkConsistency() is not working. There is a 
    problem in the parsing of the XML return by the sbml.org validator.

  - dependency on the sbml.org validator which might not be robust
    enough (you cannot submit a file bigger 15MB for example).
    It would be better to be able to install your own localy or at
    least have several mirrors. We will have to see how it performs.

  - in a mathML block, if one 'ci'element is suppose to represent a
    functionDefinition but the id is not a valid id, the type of the ASTNode
    is not set properly, so there are some errors when trying to use the
    corresponding ASTNode tree. (cf model generated by COBRA)
